# ISSTracker

A simple tracker for the International Space Station (which was not simple at all to make)

Refreshes given a set interval. In this case 5 seconds. Parameters can be adjusted in global variables.
Don't go below 1 or 2 seconds though, as the ISS doesn't even refresh that often so it's a waste of API calls.
